# Mood Checker

A beginner-friendly Python project to **track your mood**, **reflect on feelings**, and **log thoughts over time**.

ðŸŽ¯ Built completely with basic Python (no fancy libraries needed).

---

## Features
- ðŸŒŸ Interactive menu for selecting how you're feeling
- ðŸŒŸ Personalized messages based on your emotional state
- ðŸŒŸ Random "Secret Unlocks" for extra encouragement
- ðŸŒŸ Optional journaling feature: save thoughts into a `mood_log.txt` file
- ðŸŒŸ Simple and beginner-readable code structure

---

## Why I Made This
I built Mood Checker as a personal project while learning Python basics like:

- while loops

- for loops

- if/else branching

- input validation

- writing to files

- basic error handling

It helped me understand both programming structure and how to build useful projects for myself. Hope it can help someone else too!

## Future Ideas
- Build a cleaner menu system to avoid repeated code.
- Add a "view mood history" feature.
- Make it into a desktop app with a GUI (using `tkinter`).
- Add daily mood graphs.
- Add a scoring system like "streaks" for positive mood tracking.

---

## How It Works
1. The program asks how you're feeling today.
2. It narrows down emotions step-by-step until you select a specific feeling.
3. A personalized message appears based on your final choice.
4. (Optional) You can write about why you feel that way â€” it logs into a `mood_log.txt` file.
5. All moods + notes are saved with timestamps!

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (any recent version should work)
- No additional libraries required

---

## How to Run
```
bash
python mood_checker.py
```

# ðŸ“¢ Quick Notes:
- Change `mood_checker.py` to whatever you name your `.py` file when you upload.
- You can even add emojis or remove some sections if you want.
